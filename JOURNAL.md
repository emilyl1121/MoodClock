## 2025/6/12: Preliminary research + Start schematic
Today I started brainstorming my project and researching on what components I should use. I have very limited knowledge on PCB desigining and just finished working on hackpad (my first ever project) so I'm still trying to figure out what I'm going to do
Hopefully my project will work. I am thinking of using an 7-segment display, a OLED diplay along with ESP32, button for coding purposes, and LED lights for the MOODCLOCK. I want it to be able to change mood and display weather from time to time to give it personality and something that makes it different from being just a clock. ChatGPT has been a helpful resource to ask about components.

right now I have decided on my components and i placed them in the schematic. I will be continuing the schematic designs tomorrow (or later if I procrastinate)
I did some sketches and some research on the parts, as you can see in my messed-up schematic work table T-T

## 2025-6-14: Schematic design
I started learning how to wire up the parts together in the schematic so the ciruit makes sense and everything works. Right now I am still in the middle of trial and error and researching on the basics of electronics (Since my only experience was a guided project). I am trying to figure out on the resistors, capacitors, and power labels like GND, VDD. 
Some of the components I decided to use are not included in the KiCAD library, so I'd have to upload them manually.
For now, my working table looks like this:

I know that there may be a lot of mistakes and that it might be completely wrong, but I am trying my best to consult the internet and GPT.
